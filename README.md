# Email Spam Detection using Supervised Machine Learning

**Student Name:** Muhamed Ramees  
**Roll No:** AA.SC.P2MCA2401007  
**Course:** Major Project 21CSA699A

## Project Overview
This project focuses on the development of an automated system for detecting unsolicited emails (spam) using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning. The system classifies messages as "Spam" or "Ham" (legitimate).

## Key Features
* **Preprocessing:** Tokenization and stop-word removal.
* **Feature Extraction:** TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency).
* **Algorithms:** * Naive Bayes (MultinomialNB)
    * Logistic Regression
* **Evaluation:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and Confusion Matrix analysis.

## Dataset
The project utilizes the publicly available **SMS Spam Collection Dataset**.

## How to Run
1.  Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2.  Run the notebook: `spam_detection.ipynb`
